<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in automation systems, programming, and computer engineering. I have hands-on experience in programming languages such as C++, which Iâ€™ve applied in various academic and personal projects. In addition, I am proficient in NI Multisim, which has enabled me to simulate complex electrical circuits and further understand the integration of automation systems. While I have not yet had formal experience in programming languages such as Python I am confident my programming skills will enable me to quickly master a new skillset.</p>

<p>I am particularly drawn to the idea of contributing to cutting-edge innovations that resonate with my desire to make a meaningful impact through technology. Additionally, I am eager to deepen my knowledge in languages like Java and HTML, that I am already taking a course on, and enhance my object-oriented programming. I am confident that my technical background, combined with my enthusiasm for programming and automation, would make me a valuable addition to your team.</p>
